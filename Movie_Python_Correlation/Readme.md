  ## Project Name: Movie Correlation Project

#Description:
The Movie Correlation Project involved the analysis of a comprehensive dataset containing information on 6,820 movies from the years 1986 to 2016. The dataset encompassed various attributes of each movie, including budget, production company, country of origin, director, genre, gross revenue, rating, release date, runtime, IMDb user rating, number of user votes, main actor/actress, writer, and year of release. This dataset was obtained by scraping data from IMDb.

In this project, I utilized my data analysis skills to gain valuable insights into the movie industry. I began by preparing the data, handling missing values, and transforming data types to facilitate further analysis. The dataset was then explored through visualizations, such as scatter plots, to examine the relationship between budget and gross earnings.

To gain a deeper understanding, I conducted correlation analyses using Pearson's method. This allowed me to uncover the relationships between various numeric features of the movies, including year, score, votes, budget, gross, and runtime. The correlations were visualized using heatmaps, providing a comprehensive overview of the interdependencies among these variables.

Furthermore, I investigated the relationship between the production companies and other movie attributes. By numerizing the dataset and recalculating the correlations, I discovered the impact of production companies on the success of movies.

The project's findings highlighted that votes and budget exhibited the highest correlation with gross earnings, while the influence of production companies was relatively low. These insights can offer valuable guidance for decision-making in the film industry, aiding in the prediction of a movie's financial success.

By successfully completing the Movie Correlation Project, I demonstrated my proficiency in data analysis, visualization, and interpreting statistical relationships. This project showcases my ability to extract meaningful insights from large datasets and provides evidence of my skills in Python programming and data manipulation techniques.
