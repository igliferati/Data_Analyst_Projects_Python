# Project Name: Helicopter Prison Break

## Description:

In this project, we analyze the dataset of helicopter escapes (1971 - 2020) obtained from Wikipedia to find the patterns of helicopter prison breaks. The result of our analysis is based on the dataset being analyzed at that very moment; therefore, the conclusion can differ from the most updated data on the Wikipedia article.

We use basic Python techniques to analyze the data and Matplotlib to visualize some results. We find the patterns based on years, countries and escapees.

This project aims to answer the questions below:
- Which year showed the maximum number of helicopter prison break attempts?
- Which countries demonstrated the highest amount of helicopter prison break attempts?
- Which countries recorded the greatest chance of success for helicopter prison breaks?
- How did the number of escapees affect success?
- Which escapees have done it more than once?
